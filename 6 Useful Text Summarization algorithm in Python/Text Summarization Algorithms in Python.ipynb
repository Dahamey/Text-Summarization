    "**Extractive Text Summarization :** involves extracting important information from large volumes of text and organizing it into concise summaries. This method selects text based on factors such as the text to be summarized, the most crucial sentences (Top K), and the importance of each sentence to the overall topic. However, this approach is limited to predefined parameters, which can sometimes result in biased extracted text.\n",

It rewrites large volumes of text by creating appropriate representations, which are then analyzed and summarized using natural language processing. What sets this approach apart is its AI-like ability to understand text using a machine's semantic capabilities and refine it using NLP techniques.\n"

    "\n",
    "`Sumy` is a library and command line utility designed for extracting summaries from HTML pages or plain texts. It offers various algorithms for summarization, such as LSA, Luhn, Edmundson, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) :** also known as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), is a technique in natural language processing and information retrieval used for analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain. LSA aims to capture the underlying structure of the text corpus by representing words and documents in a high-dimensional semantic space. In text summarization, LSA can be used to identify important concepts and relationships within the text, allowing for the generation of concise summaries that capture the main ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Luhn Algorithm :** proposed by Hans Peter Luhn in 1958, is a statistical approach to automatic text summarization. This algorithm assigns a score to each sentence in a document based on the frequency of important words or phrases. The basic idea behind the Luhn Algorithm is to prioritize sentences that contain a high frequency of significant terms, assuming that these sentences are more likely to convey essential information. In text summarization, the Luhn Algorithm is used to identify and select sentences with the most relevant content for inclusion in the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Edmundson Algorithm :** introduced by Harold Edmundson in 1969, is another statistical method for automatic text summarization. Similar to the Luhn Algorithm, the Edmundson Algorithm assigns scores to sentences based on the occurrence of specific keywords or phrases. However, the Edmundson Algorithm also incorporates additional features, such as word location and syntactic cues, to determine the importance of sentences. By considering various factors, including keyword frequency, position, and grammatical structure, the Edmundson Algorithm aims to produce more informative and coherent summaries. In text summarization, the Edmundson Algorithm is utilized to identify important sentences that effectively capture the main points of the document.\n"

Typically, the similarity between nodes is computed using metrics like \"cosine similarity\" or \"Jaccard similarity\".\n",

These weights represent the importance of each unit of text in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative Ranking :** The TextRank algorithm iteratively updates the ranking scores of nodes based on the importance of their neighboring nodes. During each iteration, the ranking score of a node is computed as a weighted sum of the ranking scores of its neighbors. The weights are determined by the strength of the relationships between nodes, which can be measured using metrics like \"edge weights\" or \"similarity scores\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Convergence :** The iterative process continues until the ranking scores of the nodes converge to stable values. Typically, convergence is achieved when the difference between successive iterations falls below a predefined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ranking :** Once the algorithm converges, the nodes are ranked based on their final ranking scores. The top-ranked nodes are considered to be the most important units of text in the original document and can be used for tasks such as \"keyword extraction\" or \"text summarization\".\n",
